## What Is a JavaScript Bundler?[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#what-is-a-javascript-bundler)

When building web applications, things can get pretty complex. To keep everything organized and maintainable, applications are divided into multiple files.

But here’s the catch: loading multiple separate files can slow down your application. It’s not just because the browser has to make several requests to fetch these files for your web page, but also because it might load and process unnecessary code from these files.

Bundlers help to solve this problem by analyzing your application’s dependencies and generating a single file that contains all the necessary code. In simple terms, a JavaScript bundler is a tool that merges multiple JavaScript files along with their dependencies into a single file, commonly known as a bundle.

With the use of JavaScript bundlers, we transform this:

```js
<head>
	<script type='text/javascript' src='/navbar.js'></script>
	<script type='text/javascript' src='/sidebar.js'></script>
	<script type='text/javascript' src='/some-modal.js'></script>
	<script type='text/javascript' src='/footer.js'></script>
</head>
```

Into this:

```js
<head>
	<script type='text/javascript' src='/compressed-bundle.js'></script>
</head>
```

JavaScript bundlers are not limited to only JavaScript code. They can also bundle other assets, like CSS files and images. They can also perform optimizations such as [minification](https://kinsta.com/blog/minify-javascript/), tree-shaking, and code splitting.

With that said, you might be wondering if you should use JavaScript bundlers for all your projects. To answer this, let’s first understand why bundlers are important.

## Importance of Javascript Module Bundlers in Modern Web Development[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#importance-of-javascript-module-bundlers-in-modern-web-development)

JavaScript module bundlers have become crucial allies in today’s ever-changing world of web development. They handle the tricky task of managing dependencies and putting together JavaScript files – a bit like solving a puzzle.

In the past, developers used to embed `<script />` tags directly into HTML or link multiple files within [HTML pages](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-html/). But things got more complicated as the web grew. The old technique caused web pages to load slowly because of [too many server requests](https://kinsta.com/blog/make-fewer-http-requests/) and resulted in repetitive code — requiring developers to make things work for different web browsers.

This is where JavaScript module bundlers come into play. They have revolutionized the way we work with JavaScript. While web browsers now support ES modules and technologies like [HTTP/2](https://kinsta.com/learn/what-is-http2/) have addressed request overhead concerns, JavaScript bundlers remain essential.

JavaScript bundlers are more than just trendy utilities; they serve as the architects of efficiency within web development. These tools not only minimize request overhead but also enhance code structure, improve performance, and streamline development workflows.

In essence, they function as conductors, organizing code harmoniously, speeding up development, and ensuring that everything runs smoothly across various scenarios.

As web technology continually evolves, bundlers consistently adapt and assert their indispensability in creating extraordinary web experiences. But remember, this isn’t about using new tools because they’re new. Bundlers have a solid role in modern web development, and they’re a foundation for good coding practices.

Before we start exploring the technical side, let’s take a journey through the history of JavaScript bundlers.

## History of JavaScript Bundlers[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#history-of-javascript-bundlers)

In the early days of web development, managing script tags in HTML files was an exhausting and error-prone process. This led to the development of the first JavaScript bundlers, which automated the process of loading and executing JavaScript files.

The first-generation bundlers, such as [RequireJS](https://requirejs.org/), were introduced around 2010. These bundlers introduced the concept of asynchronous module loading, which allowed developers to load JavaScript files in the order they were needed, rather than having to load them all at once. This improved performance by reducing the number of HTTP requests that had to be made on the initial page load.

The second-generation bundlers, such as [Browserify](https://browserify.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), were introduced around 2011-2012. These bundlers were more powerful than the first generation of bundlers, and they could be used to bundle not only JavaScript files but also other assets such as [CSS](https://kinsta.com/blog/css-best-practices/) and images. This made it possible to create more efficient and performant web applications.

Over time, as [JavaScript features evolved](https://kinsta.com/blog/javascript-design-patterns/) and the popularity of modular programming soared, third-generation bundlers emerged. [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) (2014) focused on optimizing the bundling of libraries and packages, while [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) (2017) emphasized zero-config setups and lightning-fast development workflows.

In recent years, the rise of component-based UI [libraries and frameworks](https://kinsta.com/blog/javascript-libraries/) like [React](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-react-js/), [Vue.js](https://kinsta.com/blog/vue-js/), [Svelte.js](https://svelte.dev/), and [Angular](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/install-angular/#what-is-angular) also influenced bundler evolution. Tools like [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and [Create Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue) abstracted complex configurations, making it easier to set up projects with optimal bundling strategies.

Today, JavaScript bundlers are an essential part of the web development toolkit. They are used by developers to optimize the performance, maintainability, and portability of their [web applications](https://kinsta.com/blog/kotlin-vs-java/). As JavaScript continues to evolve, bundlers will continue to play an important role in helping developers create efficient and performant web applications.

## How JavaScript Bundlers Work?[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#how-javascript-bundlers-work)

![Multiple assets entering a strainer](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/javascript-bundling.png)

JavaScript Bundling

There are several JavaScript bundlers available, and while they provide different features, they generally follow a similar workflow. To gain a better understanding of these bundlers’ inner workings, we’ll break down the process into smaller sequential steps:

### 1\. Input Gathering[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#1-input-gathering)

To kickstart the JavaScript bundling process, the bundler’s first task is to determine the files that should be bundled. As a [developer](https://kinsta.com/blog/types-of-developers/), you clarify this by pointing out one or more main files in your project. These main files typically contain the fundamental JavaScript code that relies on smaller parts known as modules or dependencies.

```js
// main.js
Import { scream } from './Module1'; // returns string ‘scream’
import { shout } from './Module2'; // returns string ‘shout’
import { letItAllOut } from './Module3'; // returns string ‘let it all out’

// Log 'Black Eyed Peas - Scream & Shout' lyrics
console.log(`I wanna ${scream} and ${shout} and ${letItAllOut}`);
console.log("We sayin' oh we oh, we oh, we oh");
```

In this code snippet, our main module (**main.js**) imports three other modules, referred to as dependencies. It’s important to note that each of these modules may also have its own dependencies. The resolution of these nested dependencies leads to the next step.

### 2\. Dependency Resolution[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#2-dependency-resolution)

The dependency resolution step follows the initial input gathering step, and it’s where the real magic happens. While input gathering focuses on identifying the main entry points in your project, dependency resolution scans the code thoroughly within these entry files to uncover imported or required JavaScript modules. This detective work involves tracing `import()` and `require()` paths.

Think of it like assembling a puzzle – each piece fits together, and during this step, the JavaScript bundler collects information to understand how all these pieces interconnect.

![A graph explaining bundlers' Dependency Resolution step](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/dependency-resolution.png)

Dependency Resolution – Understanding the relationship between modules and dependencies

Modern JavaScript bundlers leverage advanced techniques like static analysis and tree shaking during dependency resolution. Static analysis parses code without execution, expediting dependency detection and reducing bundling time. Tree shaking eliminates unused code, ensuring the final bundle remains lean.

Furthermore, the bundler creates a visual graph representing the dependency tree. This not only showcases module relationships but also enables optimizations. Bundlers can reorder modules for quicker loading and assist in resolving circular dependencies, ensuring bug-free, high-performance code.

### 3\. Code Transformation[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#3-code-transformation)

The bundler may perform several transformations on the JavaScript code before assembling it into a bundle. These transformations can include:

-   **Minification**: removing unnecessary characters and spaces from the code, resulting in a more compact and streamlined bundle.
-   **Transpilation**: converting modern JavaScript code into older versions to ensure compatibility across various browsers and environments.
-   **Optimization**: applying various techniques to enhance the code’s efficiency. This might include rearranging and restructuring the code to reduce redundancy or even applying sophisticated algorithms to improve performance.

### 4 Asset Bundling[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#4-asset-bundling)

While JavaScript bundlers are known for bundling JavaScript code, they can also bundle other assets (images and CSS files) through a process called **asset bundling**.

However, it’s important to be aware that not all bundlers have this feature built-in. For some bundlers, achieving asset bundling may necessitate extra setup involving plugins, loaders, and configuration adjustments.

Here’s how asset bundling works when it’s supported:

1. **Asset importing**: In your code, you can use import statements to include assets like images or CSS.
2. **Asset loading rules**: When the bundler encounters these import statements, it recognizes that the asset needs to be included in the bundle. It then applies specific loading rules for different asset types.
3. **Asset processing**: For assets like images and CSS files, the bundler uses loaders or plugins. These tools process the assets, which might involve optimizing images for the web or transforming CSS files for better compatibility. After processing, they generate unique URLs or paths to access the processed assets within the bundle.
4. **URL generation**: The bundler will replace the import statement with the generated URL or path. For example: `const logo = '/assets/kinsta-logo.png';`.
5. **Bundle generation**: When the bundler creates the final bundle, it includes these processed assets as part of the bundle. They are often appended as base64-encoded data or separate files within the bundle, depending on configuration and optimization settings.
6. **Asset serving**: When your web application loads in a browser, it requests the bundled assets, including the images, using the generated URLs or paths. These assets are then served directly from the bundle or fetched from a server if necessary.

This process ensures that assets like images and CSS are efficiently included in the bundle and served alongside your JavaScript code.

### 5\. Bundling[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#5-bundling)

Once all dependencies are sorted out and the necessary code tweaks are made, the bundler gets down to the main act — bundling. It takes all the relevant JavaScript files and combines them together into one big file. This makes sure that the order in which these files depend on one another is maintained, ensuring that everything functions as it should.

![A graph explaining the bundling phase](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bundling.png)

Bundling modules and dependencies

### 6\. Output Generation[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#6-output-generation)

The final bundling process is the creation of the bundled JavaScript file, which serves as the end result of the entire process. This file houses all the code from the entry points and their interconnected dependencies, merging them into one cohesive entity. Typically, this bundle receives a unique name and is stored in a designated location.

Modern bundlers often come with extra tricks up their sleeves to enhance how JavaScript is loaded on web pages. One such feature is [code-splitting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Code_splitting), where the bundle is cleverly divided into smaller pieces, only fetched when needed. This strategic approach reduces initial load times and contributes to a smoother and more efficient user experience.

In summary, JavaScript bundlers operate by rounding up all the necessary JavaScript files, resolving their dependencies, making code enhancements, and blending them into a single, optimized bundle. This bundle is then integrated into your web page, resulting in faster load times and an improved user experience.

Rollup, Webpack, and Parcel comparison on Google Trends.

Tools like Rollup, Webpack, and Parcel take center stage in the expanding field of [modern web development](https://kinsta.com/web-development/), where the requirement for efficient asset management and optimized bundles is crucial.

### Rollup[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#rollup)

[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) is a module bundler for JavaScript that takes small code components and compiles them into a larger project, such as a library or application. It was created by [Rich Harris](https://github.com/Rich-Harris) in 2015 to address the growing complexity of JavaScript application development.

At that time, developers were struggling with the challenge of effectively bundling different parts of JavaScript apps and libraries, which was essential for optimizing performance and ensuring compatibility across various browsers. Traditional bundling tools relied on methods like CommonJS and AMD, which often led to slowdowns and confusion as web applications became more complex.

Breaking a project into [smaller parts](https://medium.com/@Rich_Harris/small-modules-it-s-not-quite-that-simple-3ca532d65de4) often simplifies the process, reduces unexpected issues, and makes solving problems easier. But, traditional JavaScript couldn’t do this.

Then, ES6 arrived, and it changed the game for JavaScript. It introduced a syntax for importing and exporting functions and data to facilitate sharing between separate JavaScript files. Although the feature was established, it remained unimplemented in Node.js and only available in modern browsers.

Rollup decided to switch things up. It embraced the new [ES module format](https://kinsta.com/blog/javascript-react/#javascript-and-ecmascript), which made putting code together much cleaner and smoother. This gave developers the power to mix and match bits of code from various libraries.

It also empowers developers to write code using the new module system while seamlessly compiling it into existing supported formats like CommonJS modules, AMD modules, and IIFE-style scripts. In essence, you gain the ability to write scalable code while reaping the benefits of [Tree-Shaking](https://rollupjs.org/introduction/#tree-shaking) and browser compatibility.

Over time, Rollup has continued to evolve and adapt. Whether you’re working on a small library or a massive application, Rollup is here to assist you in reaching your goals.

#### Advantages of Using Rollup[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#advantages-of-using-rollup)

```

Follow the prompts to choose the default preset or manually select features as needed. Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory and explore the structure. If you’re new to Vue, here are [10 essential Vue.js concepts](https://kinsta.com/blog/vue-js/) to get you started.

Next, navigate to **src/components** directory, and you’ll find a **HelloWorld.vue** file already created. Duplicate this component three times, change the name for each file, and move them to a folder called **Greeting**, so that our component library can have multiple components. The folder structure will look like this:

```bash
- src
  - components
     - Greetings
       - HelloWorld.vue
       - HelloWorldTwo.vue
       - HelloWorldThree.vue
       - HelloWorldFour.vue
```

Finally, create a **greetings.js** file in the **Greeting** folder and export all components:

```js
export { default as HelloWorld } from './HelloWorld.vue';
export { default as HelloWorldTwo } from './HelloWorldTwo.vue';
export { default as HelloWorldThree } from './HelloWorldThree.vue';
export { default as HelloWorldFour } from './HelloWorldFour.vue';
```

Now that your Vue.js project is in place, let’s delve into the world of bundlers and observe how Rollup, Webpack, and Parcel perform in real-world scenarios.

#### Rollup: Bundling Vue 3 Component Library[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#rollup-bundling-vue-3-component-library)

Begin by installing Rollup as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install rollup rollup-plugin-vue rollup-plugin-css-only @rollup/plugin-image --save-dev
```

Next, create a **rollup.config.js** file in the project’s root to configure Rollup for your needs:

```js
import vue from 'rollup-plugin-vue';
import css from 'rollup-plugin-css-only';
import image from '@rollup/plugin-image';

export default {
	input: 'src/components/Greeting/greetings.js',
	output: {
		file: 'dist/bundle.js',
		format: 'esm'
	},
	plugins: [css(), vue({ css: false }), image()],
	external: ['vue']
};
```

In the above example, three different plugins are used to ensure that Rollup can understand and bundle different types of assets:

-   **rollup-plugin-vue**: This plugin is being used to integrate Rollup with Vue.js in SFC format (Single File Component).
-   **rollup-plugin-css-only**: This plugin watches CSS imports and emits them as one asset.
-   **@rollup/plugin-image**: A Rollup plugin that imports JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, and WebP files.

With the setup complete, execute the Rollup build process:

```bash
npx rollup -c
```

#### Webpack: Bundling Vue 3 Component Library[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#webpack-bundling-vue-3-component-library)

To integrate your library with Webpack, initiate the installation of the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install css-loader vue-style-loader webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

Create a **webpack.config.js** file in the root directory of your project and configure Webpack. Here’s an example:

```js
const path = require('path');
const { VueLoaderPlugin } = require('vue-loader');

module.exports = {
	mode: 'development',
	entry: './src/components/Greeting/greetings.js',
	output: {
		path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
		filename: 'my-library.js',
		library: 'MyLibrary',
		libraryTarget: 'umd',
		umdNamedDefine: true
	},
	module: {
		rules: [
			{
				test: /.vue$/,
				loader: 'vue-loader'
			},
			{
				test: /.css$/,
				use: ['vue-style-loader', 'css-loader']
			}
		]
	},
	plugins: [new VueLoaderPlugin()],
	resolve: {
		alias: {
			vue$: 'vue/dist/vue.esm-bundler.js'
		}
	}
};
```

In the code above, three different plugins and loaders are used:

-   **VueLoaderPlugin**: Webpack loader for Vue Single-File Components.
-   **vue-style-loader**: This loader dynamically injects CSS into the document inside style tags.
-   **css-loader**: A loader that interprets `@import` and `url()` like `import/require()` and will resolve them.

We also had to use `path.resolve()` to resolve the path into an absolute path.

Execute the Webpack bundling process with:

```bash
npx webpack --config webpack.config.js
```

#### Parcel: Bundling Vue 3 Component Library[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#parcel-bundling-vue-3-component-library)

Finally, let’s explore Parcel, known for its zero-config approach. Begin by installing Parcel as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev parcel
```

In your **package.json** file, update the necessary lines to indicate your source and module files:

```json
"source": "src/components/Greeting/greetings.js",
"module": "dist/main.js"
```

Adjust the build script to use Parcel:

```json
"build": "parcel build"
```

Now, Parcel will automatically detect all the plugins and loaders your project needs and install it for you then proceed with the bundling process. Run the build script to experience the simplicity of Parcel’s bundling process:

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Conclusion: Configuration and Ease of Use Comparison[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#conclusion-configuration-and-ease-of-use-comparison)

Now that we’ve integrated each bundler with Vue to build a component library, let’s extract some observations:

-   **Rollup**: Rollup offers a streamlined [configuration process](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/) with a clear and concise setup. However, it’s important to note that certain aspects, like handling CSS and images, may require additional manual configuration. Rollup’s focus on optimization and performance is beneficial for smaller to medium-sized Vue 3 component libraries.
-   **Webpack**: Webpack provides [extensive configurability](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/), offering strong control over every aspect of the bundling process. While its configuration can be complex, it offers a robust solution for large and complex Vue 3 component libraries. The learning curve may be steep, but this investment pays off in projects where customization and optimization are crucial.
-   **Parcel**: Parcel’s zero-config approach significantly reduces configuration overhead, making it easier to get started with bundling Vue 3 components. It automatically detects and sets up most settings, simplifying the process for rapid development. Additionally, it allows developers to modify and [customize the default configuration](https://parceljs.org/plugin-system/configuration/) set by the tool.

It’s also important to note that Rollup provides node polyfills for `import()` and `export()` in the configuration file, which Webpack lacks. Additionally, Rollup accepts relative paths, while Webpack does not, necessitating the use of alternate approaches such as `path.resolve()`.

### Benchmarks: Build Time and Bundle Size[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#benchmarks-build-time-and-bundle-size)

In this benchmark comparison, we evaluate the performance of the three bundlers. These tests were carried out on a MacBook Air with an Apple M1 chip and 8-core GPU, configured with 8GB of RAM, with a focus on a Vue 3 component library of 10 components. Keep in mind that real-world results will vary depending on the complexity and configuration of your project.

#### Build Time[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#build-time)

<table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Rollup [Latest] (ms)</td><td>Webpack [Latest] (ms)</td><td>Parcel [Latest] (ms)</td></tr><tr><td>Dev first build</td><td>350</td><td>700</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>Dev reload</td><td>50</td><td>25</td><td>40</td></tr></tbody></table>

-   **Rollup**: Rollup takes the lead. It’s designed with performance in mind and excels at generating optimized bundles quickly. This makes Rollup an ideal choice for small to medium-sized projects where fast build times are crucial.
-   **Webpack**: Webpack, on the other hand, offers a wide range of features and a powerful plugin ecosystem, but this versatility comes at the cost of slightly slower build times. Webpack’s ability to handle complex projects and diverse asset types may lead to longer build times compared to Rollup.
-   **Parcel**: Parcel aims to provide an out-of-the-box zero-config experience, often resulting in a quick setup and build process. However, Parcel’s speed might lag behind Rollup and Webpack when dealing with larger projects or when more customization is required.

#### Bundle Size[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#bundle-size)

<table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Rollup [Latest] (KB)</td><td>Webpack [Latest] (KB)</td><td>Parcel [Latest] (KB)</td></tr><tr><td>Bundle Size</td><td>90</td><td>140</td><td>110</td></tr></tbody></table>

-   **Rollup**: Rollup generates small bundles by utilizing optimizations like tree shaking, ES6 modules, scope hoisting, minification, code splitting, and a plugin ecosystem.
-   **Webpack**: Webpack generates larger bundles than Rollup and Parcel due to complex configuration. Achieving smaller bundles with Webpack requires careful configuration, unlike Rollup and Parcel.
-   **Parcel**: Parcel’s bundles are smaller than Webpack’s but larger than Rollup’s because of its user-friendly zero-configuration approach, default Babel transforms, less aggressive tree shaking, and smaller runtime overhead compared to Webpack.

### Popularity[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#popularity)

An insightful way to gauge the preferences within the developer community for different build tools is by looking at popularity metrics. We used the [NpmTrends](https://npmtrends.com/parcel-vs-rollup-vs-webpack) website to compare Rollup, Webpack, and Parcel.

## Introducing Vite: The Next-Generation Build Tool[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#introducing-vite-the-nextgeneration-build-tool)

While Rollup, [Webpack](https://kinsta.com/blog/vite-vs-webpack/), and Parcel have been the traditional players in the bundling game, new contenders like Vite are emerging.

Vite (pronounced like “**veet**“) has quickly gained traction among web developers for its innovative take on the build process and its promise of faster development workflows.

Vite takes a fundamentally different approach to bundling. Instead of bundling all the code and assets in advance, Vite embraces an on-demand approach. It leverages the native ES modules in modern browsers to serve the code directly, avoiding the time-consuming bundling step during development.

This results in nearly instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and significantly reduces the cold start times during development.

While Vite’s development server utilizes the on-demand approach, it still provides optimized production builds. It achieves this by using Rollup for its production bundling, leveraging the same battle-tested bundling capabilities that have made Rollup a popular choice.

Importantly, Vite’s influence isn’t limited to just a few small frameworks – it even involves the most popular players in the web development field. For example:

-   [Nuxt.js](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/nuxt-js/): Nuxt used to be a webpack user, and it has now switched to Vite.
-   [Astro](https://kinsta.com/blog/astro-js/): The Astro team is now a contributor to Vite’s ecosystem and an active player, collaborating on enhancing the integration of these two dynamic tools to empower developers with seamless experiences in crafting performant web applications.
-   [Svelte.js](https://svelte.dev/docs/introduction#start-a-new-project): Svelte can seamlessly integrate with Vite for project scaffolding.
-   [Laravel PHP](https://kinsta.com/blog/laravel-10/): Vite isn’t limited to JavaScript frameworks. The Laravel PHP framework has also joined the ranks of those benefiting from Vite’s power. Laravel’s integration with Vite brings forth a harmony that boosts the developer experience.
-   [Inertia.js](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/inertia-js/): Inertia also embraced Vite support with Vue, making it a tool of choice for more developers.
-   [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/docs/sanity-studio): Sanity Studio is a real-time content management system (CMS). Its latest release, known as **version 3**, includes integrated tooling for local development built on Vite.

Whether Vite is the right choice for your project depends on your specific use case. If development speed, HMR performance, and a streamlined development experience are top priorities, Vite could be an excellent fit. However, for complex projects with complex build requirements or for projects where backward compatibility is crucial, it’s important to carefully evaluate whether Vite’s unique approach aligns with your needs.

## Conclusion[](https://kinsta.com/blog/rollup-vs-webpack-vs-parcel/#conclusion)
