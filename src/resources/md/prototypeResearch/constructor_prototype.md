Here is an example of how to create a

library in JavaScript

# **JavaScript library**

**__A JavaScript library__** is a library of pre-written JavaScript code that allows for easier development of JavaScript-based applications, especially for AJAX and other web-centric technologies. They can be included in a website by embedding it directly in the HTML via a script tag.

Constructor

In class-based, object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special type of function called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables.

function prototype

Function prototype

In computer programming, a function prototype is a declaration of a function that specifies the function's name and type signature, but omits the function body.

  this.books.push(book);

```



This code creates a constructor function called `Library`. The constructor function takes a name as an argument and initializes a new library object with that name and an empty array of books.

The `Library` constructor function also has a

prototype

Prototype pattern

The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the types of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects.

object. The prototype object contains a method called `addBook()`. The `addBook()` method takes a book as an argument and adds it to the library's array of books.

To create a new library, we call the `Library` constructor function with a name as an argument. This creates a new library object and assigns it to the variable `myLibrary`.

We can then add books to the library by calling the `addBook()` method on the `myLibrary` object.

Finally, we can print the names of the books in the library by logging the `myLibrary.books` array to the

console

System console

One meaning of system console, computer console, root console, operator's console, or simply console is the text entry and display device for system administration messages, particularly those from the BIOS or boot loader, the kernel, from the init system and from the system logger.

This is just a simple example of how to create a library in JavaScript using the Constructor function prototype style. You can use this same pattern to create more complex libraries with more features.
