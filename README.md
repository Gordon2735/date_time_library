Chris Ferdinandi stops by to teach us how to build a JavaScript library from scratch, using a few different methods! Check here for resources: [https://gomakethings.com/frontend-horse/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbHo3WFczOEFQQk5qeVpXcFhzYXR5ZTRBYXZYQXxBQ3Jtc0ttY1F3b3FyNHRmTkJXMzQxeHpmMHYtUFBkd0s1NGM3UVRrQ2hadXk0WF9qNjlyTXpSZkVyXzk0RmVWMV9pZWJNTkYxS0s1MUpHRFhCYWlUb1IzU1UtZ015WFVrTHZMNE5NY2xXcnViUTkwc3cyVC1vcw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgomakethings.com%2Ffrontend-horse%2F&v=ZvYhXr0hSzE) 

In order to learn some best practices, we'll build a date library from the ground up. We'll start simple and then layer in features through a series of edits and enhancements. We'll discuss a wide range of use cases and weigh the pros and cons.


### **Outline**

Here's a rough outline for what we'll be learning today...

1.  Creating a simple utility library
2.  Making the library modular and tree-shakeable with ES modules
3.  Converting it to a chainable, immutable library with OOP
4.  Providing developers with hooks to customize how it works
4.  Bundling a library for distribution and performance
5.
